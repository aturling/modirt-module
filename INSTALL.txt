INSTALLATION
------------

 * Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module. Visit
   https://www.drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-7
   for further information.

   Note: this module must be installed through the Drupal interface. The
   installation uses the Batch API which is not compatible with installing with
   drush or other command line tools.
